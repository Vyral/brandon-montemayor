What can you do to get the most money out of your home when it comes time to sell? Here’s my advice to future home sellers.

You’re thinking about selling your home in the next two to five years—what should you be doing between now and then to ensure that you get the most value out of your home as possible when it comes time to sell?

We have many ways to approach this problem. We are more than happy to come out to your house and discuss value-adding upgrades and upgrades that will be a poor investment. Having an agent’s help in that area will itself prove invaluable, since not every home will have same upgrades to boost its worth.

We can also send you our blank home inspection list. If you can start checking projects and repairs off that list sooner than later, it will save you a lot of time and stress when it comes time to list your home.

Additionally, we can connect you with a home inspector if you’d like a pre-inspection. With a pre-inspection, you can find out what things are likely to pop up during the official inspection, which also allows you to address problems before you actually get to the transaction.

If something were to come up during the transaction, you potentially run the risk of holding it up, lowering your net profits, or even cancelling it altogether, depending on what the issue is. Issues with safety and home integrity are going to be the most unattractive features for buyers to see. It’s not a bad idea to get the serious projects taken care of while you have time to space them out.

If you have any questions about value-adding upgrades and getting your home ready for the process of listing, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’ll be glad to come out and take a look and create a plan for you to move forward toward your goal of selling your home for the most money possible.
