Why wait until spring when you can sell just as well now?
We’ll show you why winter is a great time to list.

We often have people asking around this season, “Should we sell now or wait until the first of the year?” There are a few points we like to look at to help sellers make that decision. A lot of it also comes down to determining your personal situation and how it plays into what we know about end-of-year statistics.

One thing we know is that there’s less competition toward the end of the year. This means a lot of people do believe they should sell after the new year instead, but it also means that buyers have fewer homes to choose from if you list now. This will ensure your house automatically stands out as a choice for homebuyers.

People are also being relocated or deciding to move. A common moving time is during summer, but another one is around the holidays. Companies tend to move employees before January, allowing families to enroll their children in the second half of the school year. Because there is this time limit, buyers are more motivated and serious in their search around this time. They want to make a quick transition.

The holidays are a great time of year to showcase your home. On top of your decorations, you can show the sense of community your neighborhood holds. We go all out here in Santa Clarita during the holidays, so it’s a great time for people to see your home and those around it in fully decorated splendor.

On top of all this, mortgage rates are still low, and you’ll have quicker transactions and transitions when your home is sold. Buyers want to be settled before Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year’s. They’re willing to make great offers and move fast, allowing you to also get to your new residence quickly.

It comes down to what’s best for you and your family, and we’d be more than happy to help you decide what to do. Give us a call and we can walk you through the process. We look forward to hearing from you.
