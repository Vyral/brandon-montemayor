Now that we’re past the midpoint of the year, we want to give you an update on what's going on in the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market.

**Over the last year, inventory has been very low**. Nothing has really changed in this area. Right now, we have 247 homes on the market, which seems high compared to a few months ago.

Although our numbers are up by 100%, that isn’t enough to satisfy the demand. A balanced market is somewhere between 800 to 1,200 homes. In Santa Clarita, we currently have 526 pending homes and we have closed 416 in the last 30 days.

**What's driving all of this?** A combination of low inventory and low interest rates is why we're seeing multiple offers and increasing prices over the last year. FHA and VA loans have rates of around 2.6%. High-balance (or jumbo) loans are around 3.4%. For people who need to sell a property, we have access to bridge loans that will help you buy before you sell at around 6%.

If you have any questions about any of these loans or anything else related to real estate, give us a call. We'd love to help you out. Have a great day.
