Today we wanted to update all of you on what’s happening in our local Santa Clarita market. We’re going to look at the numbers, where things are, and where we think they’re headed. Let’s jump right in and wrap it up for the last quarter of the year:

Inventory started to increase a few months ago, moving towards 400 homes on the market. A normal Santa Clarita market is about 1,000 homes across all price ranges. We’ve been down in the low 200s or 400s for the last couple of years.&nbsp;

Currently, we have 230 active homes with 469 pending and 381 that have closed in the last 30 days. **That’s less than a month’s worth of inventory which means it’s still an extreme seller’s market.**

* Stevenson Ranch only has 10 homes available right now. Five cost over $1 million, and the other five are under $1 million.&nbsp;

* Valencia has 55 available homes. Nine are over $1 million; 46 are under.

* Newhall has 25 homes, with four over $1 million and 21 under.

* In Saugus, there are 49 homes available. 10 of them cost over $1 million, and 39 cost less.

* Canyon Country has 60 available homes, with 14 homes over $1 million and 46 under.

* Castaic count has 26 homes. Six of them are over $1 million, while 20 are under.

**It’s still an amazing time to get into the market because of the interest rates.** They are keeping everything balanced. We’re in the mid 2% to mid 3% range for interest rates. Remember, you need to focus on that monthly payment, not the home price.

If you have any questions or are wondering if it’s a good time for you to buy, feel free to give us a call. We’d love to help.
