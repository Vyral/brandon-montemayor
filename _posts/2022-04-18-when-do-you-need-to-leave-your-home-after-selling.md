One of the questions we get asked quite often is, “If we sold our home, when would we need to leave?” Lots of sellers want to wait until the end of the school year or a certain date because of retirement or a job transfer. We have a solution to let you leave when you want and still take advantage of this hot market.

**In this market, sellers can dictate terms more firmly.** For example, you can likely negotiate a rent-back agreement of 60 or 90 days. You could even stay in your home longer if you’re willing to lower the price, depending on how many offers there are. The bottom line is that you do not necessarily need to be out of the house when it closes. We can always negotiate and work something out for you so you can get top dollar and great terms.

If you want to talk more about your situation, give us a call at (661) 510-2789. We look forward to hearing from you.
