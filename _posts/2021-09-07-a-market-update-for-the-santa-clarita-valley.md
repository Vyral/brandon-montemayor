We wanted to give you an update quickly because a lot has been happening, and we’re sure you’ve been hearing a bit about it.

Talking inventory first, **we are up to about 361 active or coming soon homes**. That is a huge increase from the last few months where we were down in the high 100s.

**There are 511 homes pending currently, and over the last 30 days, we have had 399 homes that have closed**. The average time spent on the market was twelve days between these, which after negotiations and escrow, it’s more like they had about a weekend or so before they got offers.

Things are still moving quickly, but we are seeing pockets across the valley that are slowing down a bit. Homes that aren’t in top condition are sitting a little bit longer.

Is this a sign of a market shift, or is it just seasonal with school starting? **We don’t know for sure, and most likely won’t for a few months**. It’s worth keeping an eye on, but keep in mind that a lot of homes are still selling in no time and above listing price.

We’ll try and keep you updated as things develop, so if you have any questions about the market or anything related to real estate, just give us a call. We're always willing to help.
