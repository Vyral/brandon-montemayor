Does it make more sense to buy a home or to rent? It’s a great question because there are a lot of moving parts. In short, we think buying makes more sense than renting, even in this hot market. Let’s break down four reasons why:

**1\. Renting builds your landlord’s wealth, not yours.** When you own a home, you’re paying down your own principal balance with each payment. When you pay rent, you’re building your landlord’s equity instead.

**2\. Owning a home fixes your monthly rate**. Every time you renew your lease or move to a new property, your rent usually goes up. When you own a home, the payment is fixed for the next 15 to 30 years. Come inflation, market shifts, or life changes, that payment will stay the same.

**3\. Appreciation hurts renters but helps owners.** When home prices increase, it’ll put a pinch on your finances if you’re renting. If you own a home, that appreciation pads your pocket instead.

**4\. Rising rents make down payments harder.** It becomes harder to save for a down payment as rents rise. If you own a home, you have more equity and more money to pull from as prices go up.&nbsp;
