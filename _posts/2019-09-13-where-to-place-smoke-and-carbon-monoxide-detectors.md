One of the questions we’ve been hearing a lot lately from clients is, “Where are smoke and carbon monoxide detectors required in my home?”

**Let’s start with smoke detectors**. There are three spots that you must have smoke detectors in your home. You’ll need to have at least one in every sleeping room, one on each level of the home, and one in each hallway that leads to a sleeping room. There are different rules and regulations required when it comes to them being hard-wired or battery-operated, but call us if you have any specific questions about that.

**As for carbon monoxide detectors, these have been required since July 2011, but you don’t need as many**. You will, however, need one on each level of the home and one in the hallways that lead to sleeping areas.

One final thing I wanted to note is for all the landlords and investors out there: You are required by law to make sure your tenant has these detectors up. It’s not their responsibility to put them in. It’s yours.

If you have any questions for me about smoke or carbon monoxide detectors or anything else about real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
