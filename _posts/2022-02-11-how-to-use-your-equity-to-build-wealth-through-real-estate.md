There’s no doubt that over the last few years, home equity growth has been unreal. A lot of homeowners are coming to us, and although they're not ready to move quite yet, they're wondering what to do with all their equity. Should they invest in the home, invest in stocks, or maybe even invest in crypto? I’m offering my advice today.

This is a question that we kick around all the time. How can you use your equity to work for you and help build your wealth? We’ve looked at everything, and I wanted to offer my perspective on real estate and why it’s been such a fruitful investment for so many.

A recent Gallup poll shows that over the last eight years, real estate has been the No. 1 investment choice in the country. **It offers the highest return when compared to stocks or crypto. **

All of the inflation talk lately has convinced many people to become landlords. Real estate is one of the best hedges against inflation. If the price of milk and gas go up, we tend to see the price or rent go up. We have our own leasing and management group, and we’ve seen that competition for rentals is just as stiff as the competition for buying a home right now. Rental prices have increased a ton, and investors are reaping the benefits.

When prices level out or pull back, they’ll inevitably rise again over the long term. It’s all about your timeline and where we’re at in the market cycle. **As a long-term investment, there are few investments that are less risky than real estate.**

If you have any questions about how to invest in real estate, how to use your home’s equity to work for you, or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
