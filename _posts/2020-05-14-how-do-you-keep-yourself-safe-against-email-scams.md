<center><em>We can help you check whether you&rsquo;re the target of a dangerous scam.</em></center>

<br>First and foremost, I hope you and your family are safe and healthy during this unusual and stressful time.

I’m reaching out to you because **we’ve been hearing a lot lately from friends and clients saying they’ve been receiving fraudulent emails and snail mail scams**. Unfortunately, scammers know that more people than ever are in desperate situations and need help, whether in the form of a forbearance or refinance; they’re taking advantage of this by asking for people’s contact information. Scammers have the ability to make themselves appear like your bank, so be very careful.
