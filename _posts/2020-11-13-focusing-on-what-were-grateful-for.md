<center><em>This is what Montemayor &amp; Associates is thankful for this holiday season.</em></center>

<br>We are rounding third base on 2020, and in a year like this, it’s easy to focus on a lot of the negative things that have happened. However today we want to introduce you to the team and share what we’re thankful for this year.

#### **Alicia Echeverria:**

“Even though this year has been a true shitshow, I’ve had incredible clients give me the opportunity to make lemonade with them, if you will. I also want to thank my family: my husband, children, and extended family, as well as Montemayor & Associates. I’m so grateful to work on such an incredible team with support staff to take care of all of you guys.”

#### **Barb Clendenin:**

“With this year having been so incredibly challenging for all of us, I wanted to express how grateful I am for my friends and family to have helped me through it, and I hope that all of you have had the same joy with yours. With Thanksgiving on its way, I wish you a wonderful holiday.”

#### **Michael Brown:**

“What a year 2020 has been\! Some not-so-good things have happened, some good things have happened. I’m most thankful for the daughter I get to welcome to the world next year. I couldn’t be more excited about the new addition to our family. I’m thankful for my health and my family’s health, and I'm thankful for the job I love that I get to show up to every day. I’m thankful for our past, present, and future clients that make this job possible. We definitely wouldn’t be here without all of you. We hope everyone has a great holiday season\!”

#### **Nate McAfee:**

“This year, I’m thankful for my health, this beautiful community that we get to live in, and you guys—our past, present, and future clients.”

As you can see, there are a lot of things to be thankful for. I’m thankful for my family, our health, our friends, and, like the other members of my team have said, you. The loyalty, trust, and support you give us mean the world. We couldn’t have the lives we have without all of your support.

If there’s anything we can do to help make this Thanksgiving and holiday season the best possible end to the year, reach out to us\!
