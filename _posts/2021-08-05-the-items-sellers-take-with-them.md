Quite often, we get asked by both buyers and sellers, **“What items stay with the home and which ones go with the seller?”** Anything that is permanently attached to the wall, ceiling, or floor is considered a fixture and stays with the property. Anything else is considered personal property and goes with the seller.

An above-ground spa, pool table, pictures, TVs, refrigerators, washers, and dryers are examples of personal property. On the other hand, ceiling fans and TV mounts are fixtures. A mirror hanging up in a living room is generally considered personal property, but a mirror hanging over a sink in a bathroom is generally considered a fixture.

**We’ll always walk through and ask the seller what things they want to take with them and what things they're okay leaving**. If there's something in the house that you like, we can always write it into the contract, and if the seller agrees, it stays there.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us
