<center><em>You need to ask any potential agent these questions before deciding to hire them.</em></center>

<br>If you’re planning to enter the real estate market, you’ll need to select the right agent to help you, especially in this crazy market. We’ve compiled a list of 13 questions that you need to ask an agent you’re interviewing for the job, and today I’ll share four key questions from that list:

**1\. “Are you experienced?”** Here, ‘experience’ doesn’t just refer to their time in the business, but also whether they’re familiar and comfortable with the process you’re about to embark on. Make sure they know exactly what you’re looking to do and that they can help facilitate that process.

**2\. “Do you have testimonials?”** How many happy clients do they have, and will they allow you to chat with them so you know if the agent is doing their job? Over 90% of our business year after year comes from our database, including repeat and referral clients. We put a lot of emphasis on making sure that our clients have a great experience and are willing to tell others about us.

**3\. “Are you familiar with the area?”** Everyone on our team was either born and raised in the Santa Clarita Valley or has lived here for more than 25 years. Your agent needs to know where all the great neighborhoods, resources, vendors, and contractors are in the area you’re looking at, and they also need to know how to write offers for that specific area.

**4\. “Do you work as a single agent or as part of a team?”** In today’s market where timing is everything, you need to find a team of specialists so that you can take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself to you.

These are just four questions we have on our list of things to ask potential agents. To see the other nine questions, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/uploads/13_Agent_Questions.pdf">click here</a></u>.
