<br>The first month of the new year is already flying by, so we wanted to reach out with a quick update on what we’re seeing so far this year in Santa Clarita.

**Right now, we have just 137 active homes for sale in our market**. A normal, balanced market will have 700 to 800 homes, and we’re obviously well below that number that we need. We also had 402 pending home sales and 297 closed sales in the last 30 days.

If we look back at 2020, we had just under 4,000 homes sold in Santa Clarita. This tells us that 2020 was just as good, if not better, than the numbers we’ve been seeing over the last few years. The great interest rates out there are offsetting some of these price increases, but it’s very important that you’re prepared to make an offer as a buyer in this market. **Things are competitive, so when you get a shot, you have to do things the right way**.

As for sellers, you’re in the best spot you could be, especially if you’re moving out of Santa Clarita. **Prices are high and homes are selling very fast**.

If you have any questions about what your home might be worth, what you need to do to buy, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
