One of the questions we get asked all the time is, “Is Zillow a good resource for finding out the value of my home?” The quick answer is not necessarily. Continue reading for the full answer.

Zillow is inconsistent in determining value because there are many things it can’t do. They’re limited by their inability to see inside your home or know your neighborhood, the level of inventory, and the state of your specific market. Especially in the current market when prices are increasing and things vary neighborhood to neighborhood, **Zillow can’t always keep up**. They use a specific algorithm, but it doesn’t provide the correct value to upgrades, the location, culs-de-sac, and more. Specifically in Santa Clarita, between one street and the next, there can be a $100,000 price difference because of certain tracts for the same size home, with the same number of bedrooms, etc.

**The best way to get the value of your home is to give us a call**. We’d be happy to personally evaluate your property and accurately determine its value. Whether you’re considering selling or not, we’re always glad to help. We can come to your home or do a video chat; we do it all the time, even for clients who want to know their value for tax purposes or financial planning.

Zillow can give you a rough estimate, but it can’t account for everything happening in the market right now and all the things you’ve done to improve your property. Give us a call or send an email if you’d like us to determine your home’s value or if you have any questions. We’d love to assist you.
