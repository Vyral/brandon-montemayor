<center><em>Should you remodel your home or just sell it and buy a new one? Here&rsquo;s how we can help you answer this question.</em></center>

<br>If you’re waffling between selling your home outright and remodeling it to stay a while longer, Montemayor & Associates would love to help. Here are the steps we’ll take you through if you work with us to get your home ready for either outcome:

The first step you should take is to give the Montemayor & Associates Team a call so we can send your favorite team member out to your house. We’ll walk with you throughout your home and have you **point out all the things you’ll eventually want to do to prepare**, whether it’s a remodel or a sale.

**Then we’ll compile a list of issues broken down into two categories: cosmetic and structural**. Cosmetic issues deal with things like the paint, floors, and aesthetic style of the home. Structural issues deal with things like the plumbing, roof, and other essential systems in the home.

Once we’ve laid out both of those categories, **we’ll take a look at current market trends, your budget, how much equity you have in your home, and how much time you can dedicate** to whatever process you choose.

Using those factors and a few other questions, we’ll lay out a plan that will move you down the path toward preparing your house and making a final decision about whether you’re going to sell it or remodel.

Throughout the process, **we’ll need to be strategic**. For example, if there are issues with the plumbing, we don’t want to move forward with painting the walls, since they might have to come out for the repairs to be made. It’s important to make the most of your time, money, and energy that you invest in the home so we can position you to succeed and move on to the next phase of your life—no matter if you choose to stay there and live happily ever after or sell your home for the most money possible.

If you have any questions about this process or how we can help you make the best choices given your situation, we’d love to chat with you. Shoot us a call, text, or email to set up a free, no-obligation meeting at your home so we can get you started. We’re here to be your No. 1 real estate resource.
