It’s no secret that the market is starting to shift and change. Prices aren’t going down, but we are seeing things move around a bit. Today I want to talk about where the opportunities are for buyers and sellers in this market.

Although inventory is still low, we’re starting to see buyer fatigue set in. Some buyers who have been looking for a home for the past year have gotten burnt out and have backed out of the market entirely. The holidays play a role in this as well.

So, is now a good time for you to sell? It may be, it may not. It depends on your specific situation. However, **you may want to consider selling your home now if it falls into one of these categories:**

**1\. Bad location.** If you’re near a busy road that affects the home, buyers will have more to choose from as inventory rebuilds and they may steer clear of your home. You might get more money and attention for that home right now.

**2\. Functional obsolescence.** If you have a detached garage, for example, or a home with smaller bedrooms, this also may be a great time to consider selling before buyers start to get pickier.

**3\. A long commute.** Things have changed a lot with increased remote work. If your home is a little off the beaten path, now is a great time to capitalize on the market.

**4\. The home hasn’t been remodeled.** If you're at a point where you’re deciding whether to remodel or sell, you may want to consider selling because homes are getting the highest dollar for the least amount of work.

If your home falls into one of these categories, if you have any questions about selling, or if you just want to talk through your situation, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
