Over the last 10 years, our market has experienced extreme highs and extreme lows. Around 2007, it hit a peak and subsequently crashed, but it went back up a few years later. That upward momentum continued until around last year, when things began to flatten out.

Now, the market is forecasted to stay steady for one to two years. We’ll experience normal levels of appreciation between 2% and 4%, and there are two factors that indicate this: Inventory is still fairly low, though it’s growing in some areas, and so are interest rates. Since neither of these factors will change overnight, we can expect a consistent market for a while.

If you want to talk about buying or selling a home, have any questions, or need more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
