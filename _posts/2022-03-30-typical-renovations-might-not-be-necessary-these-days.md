Today I’m talking to all the sellers out there who are on the fence about listing their homes. You want to take advantage of the market, but you still have a laundry list of updates, upgrades, and improvements to make before you do. Your instincts are good, and you want to sell for the most money possible, but the truth is you might not have to do any of that to sell for top dollar in this market.

According to a recent survey by Freddie Mac, **nearly two in five potential homebuyers would consider buying a home that needs renovations**. If you’ve watched some of our recent inventory videos, you already know that our supply of homes is at a historic low.&nbsp;

When you combine that with historically-low interest rates, **a lot of buyers out there are willing to overlook the imperfections.**

If you’re thinking of selling in the near future, your list of necessary upgrades may not be as long as you think. If you have any questions at all about selling your home or the market in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
