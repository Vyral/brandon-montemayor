<center>There are five questions every homebuyer must ask themselves to know whether they’ve found the right home.</center>

Here are the five questions you must ask yourself to know whether a home is right for you:

**1\. Can you afford it?** Whenever we meet with a homebuyer client, for example, we guide them through the mortgage pre-approval process to make sure their finances are in order and we’re only shopping for homes that fall within their budget.

**2\. Does it meet your must-haves?** When buying a home, there’s a difference between your “wants” and your “needs,” so if there are certain things you and your family require from your new home, keep them at the forefront of your search.

**3\. Is it in the right area?** Identify the area you want to be in when shopping for homes, whether it’s because of the commute, the quality of the local school district, etc. We’ve known plenty of clients who settle in areas they originally thought didn’t fit their needs, so it never hurts to visit certain neighborhoods in person.

**4\. Is it right for your future?** You don’t want to buy something today only to end up wishing a year from now that you bought something a little bigger. If you’re starting a family, for instance, a 1-bedroom home might not be the best investment.

**5\. What does your gut say?** When you walk into a home, trust what your gut tells you about it.
