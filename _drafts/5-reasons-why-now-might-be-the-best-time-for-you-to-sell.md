There are five reasons why now is a great time to sell.

Are you better off selling your home now or waiting until fall and winter are over?

It’s a common assumption that fall and winter aren’t the best times to sell, but that’s simply not true. There are pros and cons to consider, but for certain home sellers, now may be the best time to sell, and there are five reasons why:

**1\. Less competition**. It’s simple supply and demand: Because people assume spring is the best time to sell, many would-be sellers take their homes off the market during fall and winter, which means less competition.

**2\. Serious buyers**. Buyers who are buying at the end of the year—whether it’s because of a job transfer, a 1031 exchange, etc.—are usually more motivated to buy. They’re not playing games and they know what they want, so if they like your home, they’ll make an offer and get things moving.

**3\. Agents are more available**. The best agents can step up at any time of the year. In fact, I think a lot of people who claim spring is the best time to sell are just agents who don’t want to work during fall and winter. There’s a lot of warmth in how homes look at this time of year (more on this below), and we utilize this in our marketing strategies. We also factor in homes’ best attributes and how buyers are acting in the market.

**4\. Staging**. Homes look amazing this time of year—holiday decorations are up and everything smells like freshly baked pies and cookies. This means staging is also amazing.

**5\. Quicker transactions**. I touched on this point already, but people who buy at the end of the year generally have a timeline to stick to. Also, there usually aren’t as many loans being processed or other transactions happening. All of this results in your home selling faster.
