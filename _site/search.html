        "title": "8 Simple Steps a Future Home Seller Can Take Now",
        "author": "Vyral Marketing",
        "category": "",
        "content": "These eight easy, preparatory tips are sure to put anyfuture seller’s home in prime market condition.Want to Buy a Home? Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportThere’s a portion of sellers out there who know they want to list their home, but aren’t ready just yet. These same sellers wonder, though, what precursory steps they can take to ensure that they’re in good shape when the time to hit the market comes.If this is true for your situation, here are eight easy steps you can take:1. Have us come out to the house. We’ll draw up a very specific, specialized plan for you and your home so that you’re not spending time on items that won’t bring the value you might otherwise expect. Even if you’re five years away from your move, we’re always happy to come out and offer our opinion on what it’ll take to get your home market-ready.2. Raise your home’s curb appeal. Think like a buyer who’s stepping onto your property for the first time—what would you want to see if you were them? Maybe you need to do away with some of those dead spots in your lawn, add some colorful flowers, remove an old tree stump or a shabby-looking chair. Whatever the case may be, this is a good place to start.3. Declutter the interior of your home. Create a smooth, easy walkway for future buyers to come through. An environment where a buyer has to squeeze through tight or cluttered spaces won’t bode well for your sale, and wide open spaces tend to show better.4. Repaint walls that may have an “extreme” color. Paint over lurid-colored walls with a more neutral option, and while you’re at it, touch up any nicks in the baseboards or on the walls. These sorts of things are the normal wear-and-tear of a lived-in home, but should be dealt with before your home goes to market.“We’re always happy to come out and offer our opinion on what it’ll take to get your home market-ready.”5. Put your home to the “smell test.” This may be a bit of a hit to the pride, but it’s important to have an unbiased, third-party come into your home and give you an honest opinion. They’ll pick up things you probably wouldn’t—pet odors, the lingering smells of your cooking, etc., can all affect the salability of your home. Knowing this up front could determine your course of action when it comes to painting or recarpeting as well.6. Perform a deep-cleaning. Whether it’s getting up to your high windows or dusting off shutters at harder-to-reach points, it’s a good idea to thoroughly clean these areas so that your home shows well and gets through the inspection with flying colors.7. Start to hide valuables. You should begin to box up and put away valuable belongings if you won’t be using them in the next year or so. This way, you’ll know these items are in safekeeping when buyers are walking through your home.8. Begin the staging process. Bulky, large furniture might be great for your current living situation, but when it’s “show-time,” they might make the room feel smaller and more cluttered. Because of this, it’s best to take early steps to remove some of these items, widen the open space, and create a great flow.We’d love to come out to your property and work with you to lay out a plan for your future sale. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "title": "Homeowners: Are Solar Panels a Good Idea?",
        "author": "Vyral Marketing",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Solar power is a popular topic lately. Today I’ll examine whether or notinstalling solar panels on your home is a good idea.Want to Buy a Home? Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportWhen talking about whether or not adding solar panels to your home is a good idea, there are two main points to think about.First, ask yourself, “Do you plan on living in your home for a short period, or are you planning to live there long-term?”For people who are looking to live in their home long-term, solar is a great idea.If you’re only considering a short-term stay in that property, it really comes down to whether you can afford to put solar panels on the house and purchase it.A leased solar panel tends to cause homebuyers some uncertainty; they don’t typically like to take on other people’s leases. Mind you, we’ve sold a ton of homes with solar leases, some within a few months after the selling process, but if you want to appeal to most homebuyers, a solar lease isn’t the way to go.“For people who are looking to live in their home long-term, solar is a great idea.”It’s much easier to sell a house where the solar panels are owned by the homeowner. There are no additional payments, and it provides immediate savings in terms of utilities if you didn’t have to invest in the system.Now if you’re planning to stay in your home long-term and are considering purchasing solar panels, you need to think about your income. Do you have a relatively fixed income? How much money do you have in your savings?If you’re on a fixed income, have some money in your savings, and you can afford to make an investment in your house, solar panels will help you save on your electric bill over time by bringing it down to almost nothing.If you don’t have a ton of money in your savings but you do have a consistent income, a lease is a great idea. During the hotter summer months out here in Santa Clarita where temperatures get into the 100s, solar panels will help you save big time.For any questions you have about solar panels, the logistics of having them installed, and/or the savings they’ll provide you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

That upward momentum continued until around last year, when things began to flatten out.Now, the market is forecasted to stay steady for one to two years. We’ll experience normal levels of appreciation between 2% and 4%, and there are two factors that indicate this: Inventory is still fairly low, though it’s growing in some areas, and so are interest rates.

Get a Home Value ReportWe often have people asking around this season, “Should we sell now or wait until the first of the year?” There are a few points we like to look at to help sellers make that decision. A lot of it also comes down to determining your personal situation and how it plays into what we know about end-of-year statistics.One thing we know is that there’s less competition toward the end of the year. This means a lot of people do believe they should sell after the new year instead, but it also means that buyers have fewer homes to choose from if you list now. This will ensure your house automatically stands out as a choice for homebuyers.People are also being relocated or deciding to move. A common moving time is during summer, but another one is around the holidays. Companies tend to move employees before January, allowing families to enroll their children in the second half of the school year. Because there is this time limit, buyers are more motivated and serious in their search around this time. They want to make a quick transition.“Your house automatically stands out as a choice for homebuyers.”The holidays are a great time of year to showcase your home. On top of your decorations, you can show the sense of community your neighborhood holds. We go all out here in Santa Clarita during the holidays, so it’s a great time for people to see your home and those around it in fully decorated splendor.On top of all this, mortgage rates are still low, and you’ll have quicker transactions and transitions when your home is sold.

Get a Home Value ReportIn this market, where properties carry a lot of equity, it is important to know everything you can about real estate investments. To help you out, I want to talk about capital gain exemption rules and 1031 exchanges with you today.To start with, I will explain how capital gain exemptions work.If you have lived at least two of the last five years in your current home, any equity you have built during that time can be claimed as tax-exempt gains. For married couples selling their home, this amount can go up to $500,000. A single person, on the other hand, can claim up to $250,000. You can even qualify for this exemption if you rented out your home for three of the years, as long as you currently live in the residence.“If you have already made a capital gain exemption, you can still qualify if you have lived in your current home for two of the last five years.”So, if you’re thinking about selling, this exemption can save you a lot of money.And through a 1031 exchange, you can defer all capital gain taxes if you are thinking about selling your current investment property to reinvest the funds into a new one. Of course, this exchange doesn’t apply to primary residences. It must be done with investment properties.If you have any questions about this, or if you are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.",

We don’t believe so, and here’s why.Most of these price reductions happened with listings whose sellers tried pricing their homes just ahead of the pace of the market while it was at an incline. For example, during this time, one of these sellers might’ve priced their home at $525,000 if they saw that the last home in their neighborhood sold at $500,000 and they thought theirs was better.“Most of these price reductions happened with listings whose sellers tried pricing their homes just ahead of the pace of the market.”As our market’s leveled out a bit, the excess demand for standing inventory has also leveled out.

Get a Home Value ReportWe’ve been seeing some changes lately in the market, so today we wanted to highlight a few things that you need to pay attention to, both in Santa Clarita and in the nationwide market.Inventory is starting to rebuild, which we haven’t seen in a long time in Santa Clarita. Over the last five to eight years, we were hovering in the range of 300 to 500 homes as far as inventory was concerned. Right now, we have about 650 active homes on the market. At the same time, 330 homes have sold in the last 30 days, so the market is still healthy and normal.As our inventory rebuilds, and should interest rates continue to tick up, this will knock out purchasing power for certain buyers. At this point, there’s only one thing for sellers in the market to do: be more competitive. In most cases, if the buyer pool starts to thin out, sellers need to be more competitive. Homes just aren’t selling as quickly as they have been.“Homes that are priced right are still selling quickly and with multiple offers.”In addition to this, we are seeing homes that are upgraded and priced right moving quickly and often selling with multiple offers. A lot of “experts” are saying that the market is going to start pulling back in the next year, while others are saying that we have another five to seven years of growth because of the economy.At this point, we won’t know if the market has pulled back or not until three months after it has happened. What we do know is that it’s always important to have a game plan in place. Whether that is using the equity in your home to invest, possibly moving out of the area, upsizing, downsizing, and what options you have and what upgrades you can do.No matter what your situations is, we’d love to work with you to develop a game plan. There’s no reason to panic right now, but it’s always important to have a contingency plan.

Can you count on that information when determining how much equity you have, what your home’s value is, and what’s going on in the neighborhood?We hear questions like these regarding those online tools all the time. The truth is, if you’re just trying to get a general idea of the neighborhood values, a Zestimate might get you close. However, I’ve seen many instances in which Zestimates price a home $50,000 to $100,000 higher or lower than they ought to have per the market.Zestimates and their like determine the value of your home based on an algorithm that incorporates the information of comparable home sales in the area. It can’t take into account the fact that, say, your community is gated, or if it’s located in a tract that borders another tract; one low sale in a neighboring tract can throw your Zestimate off completely.Additionally, Zillow can’t analyze what’s inside of your home, so it can’t take into account any upgrades and improvements you’ve done that might affect your value. It also doesn’t factor in the condition of the properties surrounding your home. If your home is a model match for the one next door, but yours has been upgraded where the other hasn’t, the Zestimate won’t be able to see the difference.“Zillow can’t analyze what’s inside of your home, so it can’t take into account any upgrades and improvements you’ve done that might affect your value.”Finally, these online valuation tools won’t consider the amount of inventory in your area.

Appraisers have found that, because there are so many kinds of solar panels and so many means by which a person might purchase or lease them, the potential for added value is difficult to assess.That being said, the presence of solar panels, whether they were purchased or leased, may increase the overall appeal of your home in the eyes of certain buyers.

That’s what we see in the movies, but the majority of burglaries happen between 12:30 and 2:30 p.m. The last thing the criminal wants to do is run into you. Protecting yourself in the middle of the day is most important.2. They know when you’re not home thanks to social media. If you’re on Facebook or Twitter, don’t post exactly where you are if you are out of the house or on vacation. They recently caught a burglar who hit 33 different homes. He simply watched his targets on social media and looked at the location when they posted a picture to determine whether the family was home or not. Be careful when posting photos, and don’t make a status update about your week-long vacation.3. They don’t like your security practices. If there is an easily identifiable alarm system for your home, then your home is 300% less likely to be targeted. Floodlights, leaving a car in the driveway, leaving a TV on, and turning on the lights inside all help deter burglars.4. Great targets advertise their weapon supply. Is there a bumper sticker on your car that says you own a weapon? There are a lot of burglars out there who are incentivized to steal weapons because they can sell them for a lot of money. Advertising your weapons can actually make you more of a target rather than deterring burglaries.5. Shrubs and architecture make great hiding spots. If you have big shrubs in front of your house that someone can hide behind to get into your house, that’s not good. The more open your landscaping is, the less likely it is for someone to try to break into your home because a neighbor might spot them from the street. If you do want to plant something in front of your window, make sure that it’s something thorny that they won’t want to jump through to get to your home.6. Don’t leave your valuables out in the open. A lot of the time, these criminals look through the windows to see if there are any laptops or stuff that’s easily accessible for them to go after. Put your valuables away. I also recommend hiding family calendars because those can advertise where you are going to be.“DON’T ADVERTISE YOUR LOCATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA.”I hope you found these tips helpful. I have something else to offer you today—one of my mentors and coaches, Steve Scanlon, just published his second book, “Still the Lizard.” It is an amazing read that explains what the lizard brain is and how it works.If you want a free copy, be the first one to email me with the four traits of the lizard brain. (Hint: The answer can be found at www.rewireinc.com.)As always, if you have any other real estate questions for me, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

Get a Home Value ReportToday I’d like to give you a few tips for saving money around the house. These tips might seem silly or simple at first, but they can save you a lot of money over time and they’re often overlooked by sellers:1. Make the switch to energy-efficient lighting. A standard incandescent lightbulb costs around $180 in electricity to operate each month. If you’re using a CFL or LED light, however, that’s only going to cost you $30 or $40. That’s $100+ in savings each month, and if you add up the totals for the life of the bulbs, the sum is enormous.2. Fix leaky faucets right away. Even if a leaky faucet only drips one drop per second, that adds up to over 3,000 gallons in a year. By fixing those leaky faucets immediately, you can save a lot on your water bill.3. Change your air filter regularly. When you let your filter get clogged up, it works overtime to compensate. That leaves you with dirtier air and a higher utility bill. Make sure your filter is changed every few months.4. Custom temperatures. Whether it’s with a smart thermostat or an old-school programmable one, being able to set custom temperatures in your home for when you’re not there will save you thousands over the years.5. Overwatering your yard. This will not only keep your water bills sky-high, but it could also cause damage to your lawn as well.6. Pay attention to the water heater temperature. During warmer months, you can drop the temperature in your heater down a little bit to save you a bit more without affecting anything else.7. Poorly sealed windows. If a window or door is letting in a draft, make sure you get it sealed with some caulk or weatherstripping to keep things insulated and keep your energy costs down.These are just a few great ways to save money over time as a homeowner. If you have any questions for me or want any more tips, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.",

Get a Home Value ReportTax season is here, so I want to discuss a few things about property taxes and what to do when you have some questions on those.If you plan on buying anything or getting a loan in the next couple of years, how you file today or in the next few months will have a huge impact on what you qualify for on future loans.People write off a lot of items.

We have to make sure that you have enough income on there to qualify for whatever home you are looking to purchase.There are a few other things you should know with regard to property taxes.July 1 is the beginning of the tax year for property taxes. October 1 is when tax bills are mailed. The first installment is due November 1. December 10 is the final due date you have to make if you don’t want to pay any penalties.“IF YOUR PROPERTY TAX BILL IS TOO HIGH, WE CAN HELP YOU CHALLENGE IT.”Then, the second installment is due February 1. April 10 is the last day for you to pay the second installment without penalties.Then, June 30 is the end of the tax year, and everything starts back over on July 1.If you get a property tax bill and you believe that it’s too high, let us know. We can help you challenge that.If your property tax bill is too low, then keep that to yourself!If you believe that your bank is supposed to pay your property taxes because you pay impounds, and that number seems to be off or there’s not enough in the escrow account to cover it, keep an eye on that stuff. This is especially important in the first few years of homeownership because the bank can go way off and end up having to assess you additional fees or bump your payment later on.If you have any other questions about property taxes, just give us a call or send us an email.
